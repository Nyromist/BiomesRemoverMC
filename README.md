This is a Minecraft 1.21.4 datapack that can be used to replace biomes within the chosen file.
It currently only fully supports the overworld.
More stuff coming soon maybe.

To use it, download the files and open BiomeRemoverTool.html.
Then follow the steps.

This was a fun quick project to make. I hope it is useful
